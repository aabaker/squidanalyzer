NAME
    SquidAnalyzer - Squid access log report generation tool

REQUIREMENT
    Nothing is required than a modern perl version 5.8 or higher. Graphics
    are based on the Flotr2 Javascript library so they are drawn at your
    browser side without extra installation required.

INSTALLATION
  Generic install
    If you want the package to be installed into the Perl distribution just
    do the following:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make install

    Follow the instruction given at the end of install. With this default
    install everything configurable will be installed under
    /etc/squidanalyzer. The Perl library SquidAnalyzer.pm will be installed
    under your site_perl directory and the squid-analyzer Perl script will
    be copied under /usr/local/bin.

    The default output directory for html reports will be
    /var/www/squidanalyzer/.

    On FreeBSD, if make install is freezing and you have the following
    messages:

            FreeBSD: Registering installation in the package database
            FreeBSD: Cannot determine short module description
            FreeBSD: Cannot determine module description

    please proceed as follow:

            perl Makefile.PL INSTALLDIRS=site
            make
            make install

    as the issue is related to an install into the default Perl vendor
    installdirs it will then use Perl site installdirs.

    Note: you may not encountered this issue any more, since v6.6
    SquidAnalyzer use site as default installation directory.

  Custom install
    You can create your fully customized SquidAnalyzer installation by using
    the Makefile.PL Perl script. Here is a sample:

            perl Makefile.PL \
                    LOGFILE=/var/log/squid3/access.log \
                    BINDIR=/usr/bin \
                    CONFDIR=/etc \
                    HTMLDIR=/var/www/squidreport \
                    BASEURL=/squidreport \
                    MANDIR=/usr/share/man/man3 \
                    DOCDIR=/usr/share/doc/squidanalyzer

    If you want to build a distro package, there are two other options that
    you may use. The QUIET option is to tell to Makefile.PL to not show the
    default post install README. The DESTDIR is to create and install all
    files in a package build base directory. For example for Fedora RPM,
    thing may look like that:

            # Make Perl and SendmailAnalyzer distrib files
            %{__perl} Makefile.PL \
                INSTALLDIRS=vendor \
                QUIET=1 \
                LOGFILE=/var/log/squid/access.log \
                BINDIR=%{_bindir} \
                CONFDIR=%{_sysconfdir} \
                BASEDIR=%{_localstatedir}/lib/%{uname} \
                HTMLDIR=%{webdir} \
                MANDIR=%{_mandir}/man3 \
                DOCDIR=%{_docdir}/%{uname}-%{version} \
                DESTDIR=%{buildroot} < /dev/null

    See spec file in packaging/RPM for full RPM build script.

  Local install
    You can also have a custom installation. Just copy the SquidAnalyzer.pm
    and the squid-analyzer perl script into a directory, copy and modify the
    configuration file and run the script from here with the -c option.

    Then copy files sorttable.js, squidanalyzer.css and
    logo-squidanalyzer.png into the output directory.

  Post installation
    1. Modify your httpd.conf to allow access to HTML output like follow:

            Alias /squidreport /var/www/squidanalyzer
            <Directory /var/www/squidanalyzer>
                Options -Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
                AllowOverride None
                Order deny,allow
                Deny from all
                Allow from 127.0.0.1
            </Directory>

    2. If necessary, give additional host access to SquidAnalyzer in
    httpd.conf. Restart and ensure that httpd is running.

    3. Browse to http://my.host.dom/squidreport/ to ensure that things are
    working properly.

    4. Setup a cronjob to run squid-analyzer daily or more often:

            # SquidAnalyzer log reporting daily
            0 2 * * * /usr/local/bin/squid-analyzer > /dev/null 2>&1

    or run it manually. For more information, see README file.

    If your squid logfiles are rotated then cron isn't going to give the
    expected result as there exists a time between when the cron is run and
    the logfiles are rotated. It would be better to call squid-analyzer from
    logrotate, eg:

            /var/log/proxy/squid-access.log {
                daily
                compress
                rotate 730
                missingok
                nocreate
                sharedscripts
                postrotate
                    test ! -e /var/run/squid.pid || /usr/sbin/squid -k rotate
                    /usr/bin/squid-analyzer -d -l /var/log/proxy/squid-access.log.1
                endscript
            }

    You can also use network name instead of network ip addresses by using
    the network-aliases file. Also if you don't have authentication enable
    and want to replace client ip addresses by some know user or computer
    you can use the user-aliases file to do so.

    See the file squidanalyzer.conf to customized your output statistics and
    match your network and file system configuration.

  Upgrade
    Upgrade to a new release or to last development code is just like
    installation. To install latest development code to use latest
    ehancements process as follow:

            wget https://github.com/darold/squidanalyzer/archive/master.zip
            unzip master.zip
            cd squidanalyzer-master/
            perl Makefile.PL
            make
            sudo make install

    then to apply change to current reports you have to rebuild them using:

            squid-analyser --rebuild

    This command will rebuild all your reports where there is still data
    files I mean not removed by the retention limit. It can takes a very
    long time if you have lot of historic, in this case you may want to use
    option -b or --build_date to limit the rebuild period.

USAGE
    SquidAnalyzer can be run manually or by cron job using the
    squid-analyzer Perl script. Here are authorized usage:

    Usage: squid-analyzer [ -c squidanalyzer.conf ] [logfile(s)]

        -c | --configfile filename : path to the SquidAnalyzer configuration file.
                                     By default: /etc/squidanalyzer/squidanalyzer.conf
        -b | --build_date date     : set the date to be rebuilt, format: yyyy-mm-dd
                                     or yyyy-mm or yyyy. Used with -r or --rebuild.
        -d | --debug               : show debug information.
        -h | --help                : show this message and exit.
        -j | --jobs number         : number of jobs to run at same time. Default
                                     is 1, run as single process.
        -o | --outputdir name      : set output directory. If it does not start
                                     with / then prefixes Output from configfile
        -p | --preserve number     : used to set the statistic obsolescence in
                                     number of month. Older stats will be removed.
        -P | --pid_dir directory   : set directory where pid file will be stored.
                                     Default /tmp/
        -r | --rebuild             : use this option to rebuild all html and graphs
                                     output from all data files.
        -s | --start HH:MM         : log lines before this time will not be parsed.
        -S | --stop  HH:MM         : log lines after this time will not be parsed.
        -t | --timezone +/-HH      : set number of hours from GMT of the timezone.
                                     Use this to adjust date/time of SquidAnalyzer
                                     output when it is run on a different timezone
                                     than the squid server.
        -v | version               : show version and exit.
        --no-year-stat             : disable years statistics, reports will start
                                     from month level only.
        --no-week-stat             : disable weekly statistics.
        --with-month-stat          : enable month stats when --no-year-stat is used.
        --startdate YYYYMMDDHHMMSS : lines before this datetime will not be parsed.
        --stopdate  YYYYMMDDHHMMSS : lines after this datetime will not be parsed.
        --skip-history             : used to not take care of the history file. Log
                                     parsing offset will start at 0 but old history
                                     file will be preserved at end. Useful if you
                                     want to parse and old log file.
        --override-history         : when skip-history is used the current history
                                     file will be overridden by the offset of the
                                     last log file parsed.

    Log files to parse can be given as command line arguments or as a comma
    separated list of file for the LogFile configuration directive. By
    default SquidAnalyer will use file: /var/log/squid/access.log

    There is special options like --rebuild that force SquidAnalyzer to
    rebuild all HTML reports, useful after an new feature or a bug fix. If
    you want to limit the rebuild to a single day, a single month or year,
    you can use the --build_date option by specifying the date part to
    rebuild, format: yyyy-mm-dd, yyyy-mm or yyyy.

    The --preserve option should be used if you want to rotate your
    statistics and data. The value is the number of months to keep, older
    reports and data will be removed from the filesystem. Useful to preserve
    space, for example:

            squid-analyzer -p 6 -c /etc/squidanalyzer/squidanalyzer.conf

    will only preserve six month of statistics from the last run of
    squidanalyzer.

    If you have a SquidGuard log you can add it to the list of file to be
    parsed, either in the LogFile configuration directive log list, either
    at command line:

            squid-analyzer /var/log/squid3/access.log /var/log/squid/SquidGuard.log

    SquidAnalyzer will automatically detect the log format and report
    SquidGuard ACL's redirection to the Denied Urls report.
